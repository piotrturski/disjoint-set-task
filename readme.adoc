# Disjoint Set

# Overview

Uses disjoint set. Used implementation has recursive `find`,
which kind of sucks but I couldn't find any repo-available
implementation with iterative `find`.

Therefore I created a new link:https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht/pull/442[pull request] to fix that.

# Complexity

|===
||Time | Space (iterative find)

| constructor | O(n) | O(n)
| connect, query | in practice^*^ O(1) amortized | O(1)

|===

^*^ real amortized complexity is O(α(n)) where α(n) is inverse Ackermann function.
